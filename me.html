                        Eyo! On my very own crafted, blogging website, <a>Natvandrer.net</a> !<br><br>
                        <a>Blogging websites</a> were super popular back in the day, nowadays with the apparition of mainstream 
                        social media these projects tend to dissapear. Still, that's no reason to abandon the idea of making one! <br><br>
                        It's been quite a while since I wanted to create one, fitting my style and featuring my creations.
