                            <a>Hi, it's Natvandrer</a>. I do webcoding, as well as art & desing, compose music and anything that my mind finds interesting</a> at a given moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a>Creativity has always been my favourite.</a> Surprisingly, the thing that drives me the most is the
                            making of stuff. The discovery of something new teases me to get my mind involved. It's what made
                            me progress in many various domains for sure!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No matter what I'm working on, I'm trying to be <a>meticulous and pushing the limits</a> to reach my best.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When not being submerged in schoolwork, spending time on <a>personal projects</a> is one of the first things I do,
                            whether it is a completely new project or an existing one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a>Sharing my work with friends and people</a> is definitely a plus: I'd say I'm pretty perseverant when it comes to
                            dedication, but I'll admit, having <a>positive feedback</a> always boosts the mood! :)

                            I do most of my graphics in Logoist 4, started using Pixelmator recently, and Photoshop for retouching. 
                            For 2D digital art I use Medibang. For making 3D models and renders, I use Blender.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For motion graphics (trailers and movie edits) I use Motion and iMovie, but I've started experimenting with 
                            After Effects/Premiere Pro to be able to expand my skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to game development, I'm using Clickteam Fusion Dev 2.5+
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For website projects, I build them with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and other SQL commands.

                        <p>
                            Finally, I started composing music on GarageBand, but later transitionned to Logic Pro X in 2015

                        It's been quite a while since I wanted to create one, fitting my style and featuring my creations.
